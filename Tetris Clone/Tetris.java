Solo project recreating the infamous game tetris using JavaFX

Update 4:
-New class for initializing the stylesheet
-Started working on the game. Yet there's hardly any logic only being able to move the blocks
not rotate them or anything.
-Further optimization where possible.
-The blocks have different ranges / boundaries since each is different in length they need their own border max
so far only made the I vertical
-Remade the Menu button creation now all of them use 1 method to be created just need their names and what they
will do to be passed as parameters
